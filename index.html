        <p>There have been wonderful dramatic adaptations of classic works like The Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia,
          but all have the common denominator of being adaptations. Our team at Root & Twig want to change how you listen to stories,
          bringing the works of classic literature alive through fully realized unabridged soundscape audiobooks.
          You'll close your eyes and believe you were there, with every single word from the book being used to tell the story.</p>

        <br>

        <p>We believe there is another world waiting to be discovered that will make classic literature come alive. Far too many
          great stories go unheard because of the format of the story being told by a single reader in a cramped recording space.
          The team of Root & Twig is inspired and eager to change how you experience audiobooks, taking you inside the world of the story,
          not merely getting a glimpse.</p>

        <p><a href="https://phildragash.com/" class="contactHover" target="_blank">Phil Dragash</a> is an artist
          and filmmaker based in Zagreb, Croatia who directed, produced, and performed the entirety of
          the fan-made Audiobook for “The Lord of the Rings” nearly a decade ago. Since then, the demand and enthusiasm has only
          risen as more people continue to discover it. The hope with this is to take advantage of this new format and produce more
          audiobooks like it.</p>

        <p>Alexander Amadeo is a composer who pursues music that serves something greater than a collection of
          sounds. Whether in the concert hall, a film, a gallery or a church, Alex hopes to write music that carries someone to a new
          places within themself.  In one way it is novel; yet in another way, familiar.  He is the composer for Montage Productions
          in New York City, a company that brings together video, music, text and animation in original digital productions,
          celebrating adventurers, artists and writers. Montage creates trailers to promote new books or artistic events, and films
          to document great outdoor adventures or impactful human projects. He also serves as the Music Director for Christ Church
          Winston-Salem in North Carolina.</p>
